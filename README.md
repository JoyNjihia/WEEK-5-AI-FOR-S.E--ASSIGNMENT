# AI Assignment: Predictive Modeling & Healthcare Case Study

## Overview

This project addresses key concepts in Artificial Intelligence development using a structured, real-world inspired assignment. It is divided into four parts: foundational questions, a healthcare case study, critical analysis of ethics and bias, and reflection with a workflow diagram. A hospital scenario is used to explore predictive modeling for patient readmission risk.

## Part 1: Short Answer Questions

This section introduces a hypothetical AI problem and explores the standard machine learning pipeline:

- **Problem Definition**: (e.g., *Predicting Student Dropout Rates*)
- **Objectives**: Identify 3 measurable goals
- **Stakeholders**: Mention 2 groups impacted
- **KPI**: Define 1 metric to track success

**Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Identify 2 data sources
- Mention 1 potential bias
- Outline 3 preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, normalization)

**Model Development**
- Select a model (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network) and justify
- Describe data split strategy (train/validation/test)
- Name and explain 2 hyperparameters to tune

**Evaluation & Deployment**
- Pick 2 evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall)
- Explain concept drift and post-deployment monitoring
- Discuss 1 technical deployment challenge (e.g., scalability)

## Part 2: Case Study – Hospital Readmission Prediction

### Problem Scope
- **Goal**: Predict patient readmission within 30 days post-discharge
- **Objectives**: Improve care, reduce costs, support clinical decisions
- **Stakeholders**: Patients, hospital admin, medical staff

### Data Strategy
- **Sources**: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), patient demographics
- **Ethical Concerns**:
  - Patient privacy and consent
  - Bias in historical care records
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
  - Data cleaning
  - Feature engineering (e.g., encoding diagnosis)
  - Normalization or scaling

### Model Development
- **Model Selection**: Logistic Regression / XGBoost (based on interpretability and performance)
- **Metrics**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Hypothetical Precision and Recall calculations

### Deployment
- **Integration**:
  - Model served via API in hospital system
  - Alerts or dashboard for doctors
- **Compliance**:
  - Align with healthcare standards (e.g., HIPAA)

### Optimization
- **Overfitting Solution**: Early stopping, dropout, or regularization

## Part 3: Critical Thinking

### Ethics & Bias
- **Impact**: Biased training data may worsen outcomes for marginalized groups
- **Mitigation**: Use fairness-aware models, diverse training data, rebalancing techniques

### Trade-offs
- **Interpretability vs Accuracy**: In healthcare, simpler models may be preferred even if slightly less accurate
- **Computational Constraints**: Hospitals with limited resources may opt for lightweight models like Decision Trees or Logistic Regression

## Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram

### Reflection
- **Challenge**: Ensuring ethical and unbiased predictions was complex due to data limitations
- **Improvement**: With more time, deeper feature engineering and stakeholder validation could be done
